Welcome to Stem!
================

Stem is a python controller library for `Tor <https://www.torproject.org/>`_. Like its predecessor, `TorCtl <https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer.html.en#project-torctl>`_, it uses Tor's `control protocol <https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/control-spec.txt>`_ to help developers program against the Tor process, enabling them to build things similar to `Vidalia <https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer.html.en#project-vidalia>`_ and `arm <http://www.atagar.com/arm/>`_.
